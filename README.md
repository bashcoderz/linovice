INTRODUCTION:
-------------
Linovice is a project aimed at creating a command-line–based tool that
makes Linux less intimidating for new users while preserving the classic terminal vibe.


This project is written in the Bash language.
Bash is an interpreted language, meaning scripts are executed directly by the shell program line by line,
without needing to be compiled first (unlike languages such as C or C++).


To test the project, follow these steps:
----------------------------------------
1.Download the script file.

2.Locate the folder where the script was downloaded (usually the Downloads folder).

3.Enable execution permission using the command inside quotation marks:
'sudo chmod +x linovice.sh'

4.Run the script using the command inside quotation marks:
'bash linovice.sh'
Once executed, the Linovice logo will appear, indicating that the script is running.

5.Feel free to explore the project and test its different functionalities.
